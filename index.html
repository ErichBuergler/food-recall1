                    It can spoil your appetite. Salmonella in coriander, mould in curry powder,
                     cadmium in organic avocados. These are just a few examples of the hundreds 
                     of food products that have been recalled in the last two years.  This is because
                      they are contaminated or may otherwise pose a threat to health. 
                    </p> 
                    The European health authorities have 
                    recalled exactly 649 products intended for the 
                    Swiss market alone since the beginning of 2020. 
                    The majority of these goods pose a serious risk. 
                    This is shown by data from the European Commission's Health and Food Safety Unit.

                <p> <h3>People with allergies are particularly affected</h3>
                    
                More than 70 % of the defective products destined for Swiss
                 supermarkets and restaurants have been categorised by the authorities as serious. 
                 If there is plastic in Swiss milk chocolate or E. coli bacteria in French mussels, 
                 the consequences can be devastating. Even undeclared ingredients - such as nuts in cookies 
                 from Austria - pose a danger to people with allergies.


                </p>
                As soon as a European authority discovers
                 problematic products, it triggers an international alert. 
                 This must happen as quickly as possible, even if the danger level is still unclear.
                  That is why some of the recalled goods are not categorised. A large proportion of these products nevertheless
                   end up on the market before they are withdrawn from circulation.  </p>

                  Among the food items for the Swiss market 
                  that pose a serious threat, spices were the most frequently affected. 
                  Items such as bakery products or food additives were also often deficient. 
                  This is in absolute figures. Spices are affected by recalls disproportionately to the sales volume.

                    Spices are also often affected by counterfeiting.
                     This was shown by an analysis of 23 European countries between 2019 and 2021. 
                     Nearly 10,000 analyses were carried out. The percentage of samples which were deemed 
                     at risk of adulteration were 17% for pepper, 14% for cumin, 11% for curcuma, 11% for saffron
                      and 6% for paprika/chilli. Oregano was identified as the most vulnerable with 48% of samples at risk of contamination, 
                      with olive leaves in most cases.

                    </p>Among the 649 products recalled for the Swiss market with dangerous 
                    defects were also over 50 organic articles. With a share of 8%, however, they are thus 
                    affected with below-average frequency. Organic articles account for 
                    a total of 11% of the market in Switzerland, according to the association Bio-Suisse.
                     Consumers who buy organic goods can therefore feel somewhat safer. However, the purity
                      of products is by no means guaranteed even for organic, as the figures from the European authorities show.
